Interactive Dashboard for the class teachers to analyse the students performance of a class

**Aim**: To build an Interactive Dashboard for the class teachers to analyse the students performance of a class

**Data Collection**: Real time school data gathered as the computer science faculty in the school according to the subjects and overall performance 
Individual tables for each class
Teacher Data table 

Used VLOOKUP to access students data and teachers data for the respective class selected.

**Data Cleaning and Preparation**

Handling Missing Data: Identify and address missing, incomplete, or inconsistent data (e.g., using imputation, deletion, or filling in missing values).
Data Transformation: Standardized Date of Birth column format
Removing Duplicates: Identify and remove duplicate records or rows that might skew your analysis. Ensured with correct and unique admission number.
Feature Engineering: Created Rank column, Grade column for clear understanding
Outlier detection 

**Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

Calculated basic statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) to get a sense of the distribution of grades, attendance, etc.
Grade Distribution gives the performance of students in a glance
box plots reval the subjects performance 
Gender Distribution in school in the area reveals a lot about the culture and awareness of the people



**Data Visualization and Reporting**

Student - Teacher Ratio KPI

Created Box plots to compare and visualize subjects preformanceof the class
Ceated column chart showcasing the Grade Distribution in the class
Ceated pie-chart revealing  the Gender Distribution in the class
Created barchart for the Top 5 Performers of the class
Created barchart for the Bottom 5 Under Performers of the class
Created a scatter plot to understand the correlation between attendance vs scores

**Recommendations**

Revision pattern for the underperforming subjects
Focussing on Underperformers to improve overall performance of the school
Provide extra tutoring or resources for low-performing students.
Implement attendance monitoring programs to reduce absenteeism.
Adjust teaching strategies or exam preparation to address identified gaps.
Intervene with students predicted to fail
Feedback Loop: Gather feedback from educators, administrators, or students and refine the analysis based on their input.
