# Students-Performance-Analysis-using-MS-Excel

### 📝 **Project Overview**

An Excel-based project designed to help schools, teachers, parents, and students analyze academic performance through:

This project demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be leveraged as a lightweight analytics tool for educational institutions 
where access to advanced tools (like Power BI or Tableau) may be limited.

### 🎯 **Aim**

- Build an Interactive Dashboard for teachers to analyze class-level performance.

- Build an Interactive Report Card for parents and students to track individual performance.

### 📂 **Data Collection**

Real-time school data gathered as part of computer science faculty responsibilities.

Individual tables for each class (subjects & performance).

A Teacher table with teacher details.

### 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

1. Handling Missing Data – Imputation/deletion/filling missing values.

2. Data Transformation – Standardized Date of Birth format.

3. Removing Duplicates – Ensured unique records using Admission Numbers.

4. Feature Engineering – Created Rank, Grade, and other derived columns.

5. Outlier Detection – Identified unusual records affecting performance stats.

6. Used VLOOKUP to automatically grade students in their subject and overall score

7. Used VLOOKUP to access students data using admission number, class

### 🚀 **How to Use**

Open Interactive_ReportCard.xlsx → Enter Admission Number → Auto-report generated.

Open Class_Performance_Dashboard.xlsx → Choose Class → Dashboard updates with KPIs & charts.

### 🗂️ **Repository Structure**

|         File                | Description |
|-----------------------------|-------------|
| `dashboard screenshot`  | Class Teacher Dashboard |
| `Report Card Screenshot`  | student Report card Dashboard |
| `README.md`                           | Project documentation |

### 💡 **Recommendations**

- Identify underperforming subjects and Create early intervention programs for students at risk of failing.

- Monitor attendance to reduce absenteeism.

- Establish a feedback loop from teachers, students, and administrators.

### 🔔 **Note**

Developed as part of a school academic performance analysis initiative, using Excel as the primary tool for accessibility.

Visuals and dashboards are custom-designed to make data easy to understand for non-technical users.

Feedback Loop: Gather feedback from educators, administrators, or students and refine the analysis based on their input.
