An Excel-based project designed to help schools, teachers, parents, and students analyze academic performance through:

This project demonstrates how Microsoft Excel can be leveraged as a lightweight analytics tool for educational institutions 
where access to advanced tools (like Power BI or Tableau) may be limited.

### 🎯 **Aim**

- Build an Interactive Dashboard for teachers to analyze class-level performance.

- Build an Interactive Report Card for parents and students to track individual performance.

### 📂 **Data Collection**

Real-time school data gathered as part of computer science faculty responsibilities.

Individual tables for each class (subjects & performance).

A Teacher table with teacher details.

### 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Preparation**

1. Handling Missing Data – Imputation/deletion/filling missing values.

2. Data Transformation – Standardized Date of Birth format.

3. Removing Duplicates – Ensured unique records using Admission Numbers.

4. Feature Engineering – Created Rank, Grade, and other derived columns.

5. Outlier Detection – Identified unusual records affecting performance stats.

6. Used VLOOKUP to grade students in their subject and overall score

7. Used VLOOKUP to access students data using admission number, class

### 💡 **Recommendations**

- Identify underperforming subjects and Create early intervention programs for students at risk of failing.

- Monitor attendance to reduce absenteeism.

- Establish a feedback loop from teachers, students, and administrators.
